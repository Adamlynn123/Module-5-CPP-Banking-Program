# Overview

The purpose of creating this program is to learn about the C++ Programming language and how it is different and similar to Python which is my first and most familiar programming language. 

The program is a banking program that allows the user to create an account, deposit or withdraw money, and display account details.

# Development Environment

This program is written in the C++ programming language with Visual Studio Code as my text editor. I used the stdio.h and conio.h libraries to help with user input and displaying outputs.

# Future Work

* One thing that I want to change is to make the program more readable by adding more space between user inputs and outputs.
* Another change to make the program more usable is to actually save user account information into another file.
